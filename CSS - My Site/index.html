      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student in the Thermofluids program from the University of Central Florida and I am considering in specializing in Finite Element Analysis &/or Computational Fluid Dynamics. As a mechanical engineer and
        student, I enjoy working with others to select the best ideas to solve problems and challenges. With that, I love to be rewarded for my efforts to solve those problems and challenges. My strengths are in heat transfer, thermodynamics, and
        fluid mechanics and using engineering software applications such as 3D CAD, CAE, and programming to support any engineering applications and challenges. In the future, I see myself having a career in Aerospace, Space, or Tech industries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am an open-minded person who listens to others and ask questions. If I don't know the answer, I will try to seek the answers. I always try my best to be creative, innovative, collaborative, and accountable on the regular basis while
        valuing happiness, respect, family, and friend. I am confidence to apply these key skills and values to become an overall better person and engineer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During my pastime, I enjoy playing PC video games and hanging out with friends and families. I am believe that the best way to connect with people is through outdoor recreation activities. Some of my personal favorite outdoor recreational
        activities include skateboarding, paint balling, and hiking. I occasionally put some time in my journey to becoming financially free while doing my passion as an engineer by continuously learning and investing in the business and market.</p>
